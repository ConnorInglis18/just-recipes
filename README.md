# Just Recipes Front-End

This is the front end repository for Just Recipes. The website that gives the user
everything you want out of a recipe, and nothing more. To run the frontend code run

npm i

npm run start

This will start up the frontend on localhost. There is also a backend component to
this project. That repo, and instructions on how to start the backend, can be found
